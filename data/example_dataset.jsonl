{"instruction": "What is machine learning?", "input": "", "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."}
{"instruction": "Explain what a neural network is", "input": "", "output": "A neural network is a computing system inspired by biological neural networks. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information by passing signals and adjusting connection weights."}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?", "input": "", "output": "Supervised learning uses labeled training data where the correct outputs are known, while unsupervised learning discovers patterns in unlabeled data without predefined categories."}
{"instruction": "Define overfitting in machine learning", "input": "", "output": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data."}
{"instruction": "What is a loss function?", "input": "", "output": "A loss function measures how well a machine learning model's predictions match the actual outcomes. It quantifies the error and guides the optimization process during training."}
