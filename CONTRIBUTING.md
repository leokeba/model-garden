```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/model-garden.git
cd model-garden

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/model-garden.git
```

### Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
uv pip install -e ".[dev,test]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Make Your Changes

1. Write your code following our [Code Standards](#code-standards)
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Run tests and code quality checks

### Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add carbon tracking visualization"
```

#### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(training): add LoRA fine-tuning support
fix(api): handle timeout errors in inference endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(carbon): add unit tests for emission calculations
```

---

## Code Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 100 characters (not 79)
- **String quotes**: Double quotes preferred
- **Imports**: Organized with `isort`
- **Type hints**: Required for all functions

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format code with ruff
ruff format .

# Check formatting
ruff format --check .
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run linter
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix .
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Run type checker
mypy model_garden
```

### Example Code

```python
"""Module for training job management."""

from typing import Optional
from datetime import datetime
from pydantic import BaseModel


class TrainingJob(BaseModel):
    """Represents a model training job.
    
    Attributes:
        job_id: Unique identifier for the job
        name: Human-readable name for the job
        status: Current status of the job
        created_at: Timestamp when job was created
    """
    
    job_id: str
    name: str
    status: str
    created_at: datetime


def create_training_job(
    name: str,
    base_model: str,
    dataset_id: str,
    learning_rate: float = 2e-4,
) -> TrainingJob:
    """Create a new training job.
    
    Args:
        name: Name for the training job
        base_model: Base model identifier
        dataset_id: Dataset to use for training
        learning_rate: Learning rate for training
        
    Returns:
        Created training job instance
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If name is empty or invalid
    """
    if not name:
        raise ValueError("Job name cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    ...
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Mirror the source structure (`tests/test_training.py` for `model_garden/training.py`)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases

### Test Structure

```python
"""Tests for training job management."""

import pytest
from model_garden.training import create_training_job


def test_create_training_job_success():
    """Test successful training job creation."""
    job = create_training_job(
        name="test-job",
        base_model="llama-3-8b",
        dataset_id="dataset-123"
    )
    
    assert job.name == "test-job"
    assert job.status == "pending"


def test_create_training_job_invalid_name():
    """Test that empty name raises ValueError."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="cannot be empty"):
        create_training_job(
            name="",
            base_model="llama-3-8b",
            dataset_id="dataset-123"
        )


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_operation():
    """Test asynchronous operations."""
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result is not None
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_training.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=model_garden --cov-report=html

# Run only fast tests (skip slow integration tests)
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
