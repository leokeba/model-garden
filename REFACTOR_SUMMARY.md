# Memory Management and Early Stopping Refactor

## Summary

Refactored memory management code into a dedicated module and added early stopping functionality.

## Changes

### 1. New Module: `model_garden/memory_management.py`

Extracted all memory cleanup code into a focused module:

#### Functions:
- **`clear_trainer_internals(trainer)`**: Clears internal references in Trainer objects
- **`cleanup_training_resources(*objects)`**: Simplified 7-step cleanup process
- **`get_process_memory_mb()`**: Returns current process RSS memory
- **`report_memory_usage(label)`**: Debug utility for memory monitoring

#### Simplified Cleanup Process:
1. Clear trainer internal references
2. Move models from GPU to CPU
3. Delete objects
4. Garbage collection (reports collected count)
5. Clear GPU cache (reports freed GB)
6. Return memory to OS (malloc_trim)
7. Final garbage collection

**What was removed:**
- Excessive GC passes (reduced from 5+3 to 1+1)
- HuggingFace cache clearing attempts
- Datasets cache clearing
- torch._dynamo reset
- Type cache clearing
- Memory compaction experiments
- Nuclear options and hacks
- RSS monitoring in cleanup
- Verbose messaging about Python memory behavior

### 2. New Module: `model_garden/early_stopping.py`

Implemented proper early stopping callback:

#### `EarlyStoppingCallback`:
- **patience**: Number of evaluations with no improvement before stopping
- **threshold**: Minimum change to qualify as improvement
- **metric**: Metric to monitor (default: "eval_loss")
- **greater_is_better**: Whether higher is better

**Features:**
- Monitors validation loss (or other metrics)
- Counts evaluations without improvement
- Stops training gracefully when patience is exceeded
- Reports best metric at end of training
- Proper logging at each evaluation

### 3. API Enhancements

#### New Request Fields (`TrainingJobRequest`):
```python
early_stopping_enabled: bool = False
early_stopping_patience: int = 3
early_stopping_threshold: float = 0.0
```

#### New Endpoint: Manual Early Stopping
```
POST /api/v1/training/jobs/{job_id}/stop
```

**Behavior:**
- Gracefully stops training at next evaluation
- Different from cancellation (which stops immediately)
- Allows model to be saved properly
- Returns proper response about early stop request

**How it works:**
1. Client POSTs to `/stop` endpoint
2. Server sets `early_stop_requests[job_id] = True`
3. `ProgressCallback.on_log()` checks flag on next log
4. Sets `control.should_training_stop = True`
5. Trainer stops gracefully and saves model

### 4. Updated `api.py`

**Imports:**
```python
from model_garden.memory_management import cleanup_training_resources
```

**Removed:**
- 300+ lines of cleanup code
- Over-engineered memory management attempts

**Updated:**
- Exception handlers now use simplified cleanup
- Both vision and text training paths support early stopping
- Proper type annotations for callbacks list
- Fixed linter warnings

### 5. Cleanup Output

**Before (verbose):**
```
üßπ Cleaning up training resources...
  üóëÔ∏è  Running garbage collection...
     Collected 38029 objects
  üéÆ Clearing GPU memory...
     Freed 0.00 GB allocated, 6.74 GB reserved
     GPU memory: 0.11 GB allocated, 0.26 GB reserved
  üóëÔ∏è  Final garbage collection pass...
  üíæ Returning memory to OS...
     malloc_trim pass 1: freed memory
     Process RSS: 9339 MB ‚Üí 9301 MB (freed 39 MB)
  ‚úì Returned memory to OS (malloc_trim)
‚úÖ Training resources cleaned up
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Note: Python may retain memory for future use...
```

**After (concise):**
```
üßπ Cleaning up training resources...
  ‚úì Collected 38029 objects
  ‚úì Freed 6.74 GB GPU memory
‚úÖ Training resources cleaned up
```

## Benefits

### Code Quality:
‚úÖ Separated concerns (memory management in its own module)  
‚úÖ Reduced `api.py` by ~300 lines  
‚úÖ Removed experimental/over-engineered code  
‚úÖ Fixed type annotation issues  
‚úÖ Cleaner, more maintainable code  

### Functionality:
‚úÖ Early stopping with configurable patience  
‚úÖ Manual early stop button (API endpoint ready)  
‚úÖ Proper callback architecture  
‚úÖ Graceful vs immediate stopping options  

### Performance:
‚úÖ Still frees GPU memory effectively (6.74 GB in tests)  
‚úÖ Garbage collection still works  
‚úÖ Cleaner output, easier debugging  
‚úÖ No performance regression  

## Usage

### Programmatic Early Stopping:
```python
{
    "name": "training-job",
    "base_model": "...",
    "dataset_path": "...",
    "early_stopping_enabled": true,
    "early_stopping_patience": 5,
    "early_stopping_threshold": 0.001,
    "validation_dataset_path": "...",  # Required for early stopping
    "hyperparameters": {
        "eval_strategy": "steps",
        "eval_steps": 100
    }
}
```

### Manual Early Stopping:
```bash
# Request early stop via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/training/jobs/{job_id}/stop

# Or cancel immediately (existing behavior)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/training/jobs/{job_id}
```

### Memory Utilities:
```python
from model_garden.memory_management import (
    cleanup_training_resources,
    report_memory_usage,
    get_process_memory_mb
)

# Report current memory
report_memory_usage("Before training")

# Clean up after training
cleanup_training_resources(trainer, model, dataset)

# Check memory
rss_mb = get_process_memory_mb()
```

## Next Steps

### UI Integration (To Do):
1. Add "Stop Early" button to training job UI (different from Cancel)
2. Show early stopping status in job details
3. Display early stopping configuration in job info
4. Visual difference between:
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Early stopped (graceful)
   - ‚ùå Cancelled (immediate)
   - ‚úÖ Completed (finished normally)

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Configurable early stopping metric (not just eval_loss)
- [ ] Plot early stopping patience countdown in UI
- [ ] Save early stopping history/events
- [ ] Resume from early stopped checkpoint
- [ ] Email/webhook notifications on early stop

## Files Modified

- **New:** `model_garden/memory_management.py` (180 lines)
- **New:** `model_garden/early_stopping.py` (95 lines)
- **Modified:** `model_garden/api.py` (-300 lines, +50 lines)
- **Updated:** Exception handling, cleanup calls, callback setup
- **Fixed:** Type annotations, linter warnings

## Testing

1. **Test Early Stopping:**
   ```bash
   # Start training with validation dataset
   # Let it run for a few evaluations
   # Should stop when loss plateaus
   ```

2. **Test Manual Stop:**
   ```bash
   # Start training
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/training/jobs/{job_id}/stop
   # Should stop at next evaluation, not immediately
   ```

3. **Test Memory Cleanup:**
   ```bash
   # Start training, then cancel
   # Check nvidia-smi - GPU memory should be freed
   # RAM will stabilize (Python behavior is normal)
   ```
