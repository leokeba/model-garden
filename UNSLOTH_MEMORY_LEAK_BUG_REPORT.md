# Unsloth Vision Training Memory Leak - Bug Report

## Summary
UnslothVisionDataCollator has a severe memory leak during training: **~170 MB per 10 steps (~1.0-1.2 GB/minute)**. The leak causes OOM in 15-20 minutes with 32GB RAM.

## Environment
- **Unsloth**: Latest version (with vision support)
- **Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (4-bit quantized)
- **Dataset**: Barth371/cmr-all (663 examples with base64-encoded images)
- **Training**: batch_size=2, gradient_accumulation=4
- **System**: Python 3.13, PyTorch 2.8.0+cu128, 32GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU

## Evidence of Leak

### 1. Training Memory Growth (Real Data)
```
Step 10: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 5552 MB
Step 20: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 7159 MB (+1607 MB)
Step 30: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 8851 MB (+1692 MB)
Step 40: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 10375 MB (+1524 MB)
Step 50: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 12000 MB (+1625 MB)
Step 60: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 13757 MB (+1757 MB)
Step 70: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 15559 MB (+1802 MB)
Step 80: 6529 tensors (CPU: 330, GPU: 6199), Process RAM: 17412 MB (+1853 MB)
```

**Key Observation**: Tensor count remains **completely stable** at 6529 tensors, but RAM grows by ~170 MB per 10 steps.

### 2. Isolated Component Tests (All Passed ✅)
We tested each component in isolation:

#### Test: PIL Images
```python
# Load 663 images from dataset
raw_dataset = load_dataset("Barth371/cmr-all")
formatted_dataset = format_dataset(raw_dataset)  # Creates PIL images

# Result: 733 MB one-time cost, NO leak during iteration
for epoch in range(3):
    for sample in formatted_dataset:
        pass  # Memory stable
```

#### Test: Qwen2VL Processor
```python
# Process 100 images
for i in range(100):
    processed = processor(text=text, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    
# Result: Only 10 MB growth for 100 processings, NO leak
```

#### Test: Tensor Conversion WITH Cleanup
```python
for i in range(100):
    processed = processor(text=text, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    # CRITICAL: Explicit cleanup
    del processed
    gc.collect()
    
# Result: NO leak (memory stable)
```

#### Test: Tensor Conversion WITHOUT Cleanup
```python
processed_list = []
for i in range(100):
    processed = processor(text=text, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    processed_list.append(processed)  # Keep reference
    
# Result: MASSIVE leak (+700 MB for 100 conversions)
```

### 3. Conclusion from Tests
- All components work correctly in isolation
- Leak ONLY occurs during actual training with UnslothVisionDataCollator
- Explicit cleanup (del + gc.collect()) prevents leak in isolated tests
- Real training still leaks despite aggressive GC

## Root Cause Analysis

### What We've Ruled Out
1. ❌ **Python object accumulation** - Tensor count is stable (GC works)
2. ❌ **Gradients not cleared** - We call `model.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)`
3. ❌ **Trainer internal state** - We clear Trainer._past and other attributes
4. ❌ **PIL Images** - Tested in isolation, no leak
5. ❌ **Processor** - Tested in isolation, minimal growth
6. ❌ **Pinned memory** - Disabling didn't help
7. ❌ **GPU memory** - This is system RAM leak, not VRAM

### What's Left
The leak MUST be in **UnslothVisionDataCollator's C++ implementation**:

1. **C++ memory allocations** that Python's GC cannot see
2. **Memory pools or buffers** that aren't being freed
3. **Reference counting issues** in C++ extension code
4. **Image processing buffers** that accumulate

## Why We Believe It's UnslothVisionDataCollator

### Evidence:
1. **Isolated test works**: When we manually process batches and clean up, NO leak
2. **Training leaks**: When UnslothVisionDataCollator processes batches, MASSIVE leak
3. **Stable tensor count**: Python GC is working, leak is not Python-level
4. **Trainer state cleared**: We tried clearing Trainer's internal state, didn't help

### Code Comparison:

**Working (Isolated Test)**:
```python
for batch in dataset:
    processed = processor(text=text, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    # Use processed data...
    del processed  # ← Explicit cleanup
    gc.collect()   # ← Python GC frees memory
```

**Leaking (Real Training)**:
```python
# trainer.train() uses UnslothVisionDataCollator internally
trainer = SFTTrainer(
    data_collator=UnslothVisionDataCollator(model, processor),
    ...
)
trainer.train()  # ← Leaks memory, collator doesn't clean up
```

## Attempted Fixes (All Failed)

1. ✅ **Per-step gc.collect()** - Doesn't help (leak is C++ level)
2. ✅ **Clear optimizer state** - Not the cause
3. ✅ **Clear Trainer._past** - Not the cause
4. ✅ **Disable dataloader_pin_memory** - Not the cause
5. ✅ **PyTorch memory allocator config** - Only affects GPU
6. ✅ **Zero gradients with set_to_none** - Already doing this
7. ✅ **Clear Trainer internal state via callback** - Doesn't help

## Reproduction Steps

1. Install Unsloth with vision support
2. Load Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (4-bit)
3. Load any vision dataset (we used Barth371/cmr-all)
4. Train with UnslothVisionDataCollator
5. Monitor process memory with `psutil`
6. Observe: RAM grows ~170 MB per 10 steps, system OOMs in 15-20 minutes

## Request

Could you investigate UnslothVisionDataCollator's C++ implementation for memory leaks? Specifically:

1. Are processed tensors/images being properly freed after each batch?
2. Are there any memory pools or buffers that accumulate?
3. Is there proper reference counting for C++ objects?

## Workarounds (For Users)

Until fixed, users can:

1. **Subprocess isolation**: Run training in subprocess with memory monitoring
2. **Memory limits**: Set ulimit and gracefully stop before OOM
3. **Restart training**: Checkpoint frequently, restart when memory high
4. **Reduce batch size**: Slower leak with smaller batches

## Additional Data Available

We have extensive test scripts and monitoring data if needed. We can provide:
- Memory profiling output
- Test scripts for reproduction
- Detailed logs from investigation callbacks
- Tensor count vs RAM growth charts

Thank you for Unsloth's amazing work! We hope this detailed report helps identify and fix the issue.
